# PyBer_Analysis
This was my best attempt to complete the assignment at this point.  I was able to successfully complete part one of the challenge, and all parts of the preparation for final charting, but was not able to get my chart to run correctly, due to ongoing inability to get rid of the multilayered index on the final pivot.  It appeared to be gone but even with reset.index and set.index multiple attempts, hours of "Googling" and assistance from TA's, the graph would not format correctly, due in part to the resampled dates that would not render correctly.
## Interpretation of the data
Based on what I was able to ascertain, average fares are higher in the rural cities, but because volume is so much lower, the overall profit in the rural areas is much lower.  The pivot table from part one demonstrates that.  While I failed to reproduce the correct visualization, I would venture to say that adding more resources (drivers) to rural areas might be a possible business choice, in order to bolster profits
